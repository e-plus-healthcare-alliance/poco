This is the document for migrating data from tuijianbao.net to haoyaoshi server.

1. You need to move the mongodb:
    1. tjb-db
        * sites collection. the record with "haoyaoshi" as site_id
    2. tjbsite_haoyaoshi (be careful to preserve the indexes)

2. You need to copy the whole ES data dir.

3. For Batch/Dashboard/Adminboard: use the poco_1.6 branch.
