== Setup of the Django server ==
    0. install packages in requirements.txt
    1. copy local_config.py.EXAMPLE as local_config.py and modify if it is necessary.

    3. Also don't forget to set up the MONGODB_HOST/replica_set correctly.
    4. And for production site, you need to config "CACHES" in local_settings.py. Check local_config.py.EXAMPLE to explaination.
    5. "python manage.py syncdb"
    6. Also run "celery -A search_demo worker" in the root dir of the search_demo project
